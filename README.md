# Angular + Node Contact Manager

## Exercise files for Lynda.com course: Angular API Communication and Authentication

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2.

## Using the files

Exercise files for each video can be found in the `exercise-files` folder, which contains the code files at the start state and end state for each video. If at any point you wish to jump in to a specific video's exercise files, be sure to run `npm install` to install your dependencies. Please note that not every video will have exercise files.

I recommend you start with the `start-here` folder (go ahead and rename it), and make changes in that directory as you work through each video. The completed app is in `completed-app`.

**Note**
Always make sure you make a copy of `.env.sample`, rename it to `.env`, and add in the necessary environemtn variables for both the JWT secret and the MongoDB connection string.

## Build tasks

Different `npm` scripts for your workflow:
  * `npm start`: this will run a production build of the Angular app, and place the bundles in `server/public` directory, and then will start the Node + Express app. This is typically what you would want to do if deploying the applicaiton.
  * `npm run watch`: this will utilize webpack-dev-server to run the Angular app in a live development server, watching for any changes, and also start the Express app at port 3000. Since the app is running on port 4200, we supply a proxy config file to proxy all requests to `/api` to `localhost:3000/api`. Making changes to your code will live reload both the client and the server. Use this for development.
  * `npm run sample`: this will seed your database with initial contacts and users.
